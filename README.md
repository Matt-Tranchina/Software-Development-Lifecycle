# Software-Development-Lifecycle

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating "user stories" help with this?
I would view myself as the user and imagine what would work best for me, or how I would like to engage the the needs in the program. Creating "user stories" helps because it acts like bullet points, or key features, that I would like to see in the program.
  
# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I would approach developing a program with openess and transparency. I would work with a team and fully discuss how a function should act, be called, how it is stored, and so on. I hope to incorporate communication in my future development work. I believe the only stupid question is the one not asked. 
  
# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A good team member is someone who is open, knows how to communicate, and knows when to ask for help. No one knows everything so it is important to ask for assistance in a concept is not understood, or if I do not know how to apply certain code. A good team member is also a self starter, knows how to start a task and is determined to see it through without being told.
